                <p> <b>Part 1 & 2: </b> The Professor recruits a team of eight skilled criminals, each codenamed after a city,
                    to carry out a heist on the Royal Mint of Spain. The plan is not to steal existing money, 
                    but to print nearly a billion euros while holding 67 hostages. The narrative is told from the perspective of one of the robbers, 
                    Tokyo, and features numerous flashbacks to the group's training period. The heist is a battle of wits between the Professor on the outside and the police, 
                    particularly the lead negotiator, Inspector Raquel Murillo.Part 3, 4 & 5: The team is forced out of hiding after one of their own, Rio, is captured by authorities.
                    To rescue him and honor a friend, they orchestrate an even more audacious plan: a heist on the Bank of Spain, 
                    with the goal of stealing gold. New members and old rivalries complicate their mission, pushing them to their limits.

                <div class="col-6">
                    <p><i><b>"Leo Das"</b> - moves through the world like a whisper, unseen yet impossible to ignore. On the surface,
                        he blends in, polite and unassuming, but beneath that calm exterior lies a mind always calculating, 
                        a heart always aware. His alter ego thrives in the edges of reality, where rules bend and shadows speak truths others refuse to see. Every step he takes is deliberate, 
                        every glance carries a story unspoken. He collects moments like weapons, memories sharpened into instincts,
                        ready to strike when the need arises. Leo’s world is one of contrasts: light and dark, silence and chaos, control and instinct.
                        In his dual existence, he is both the observer and the storm, a man who can vanish into the ordinary yet reshape reality with a single choice.
                        Those who know him rarely see the same Leo twice, for his alter ego is fluid, a mirror of circumstance, a reflection of power and precision intertwined.
                        He navigates the gray zones of morality and law with a deftness few can comprehend, stepping lightly between order and chaos. His memories are tools, 
                        memories sharpened into weapons, each one shaping his perception, his actions, and his ability to read the hearts and minds of those around him.
                        Leo thrives where others falter, where rules blur and the world’s edges threaten to crumble. He is both ghost and storm, observer and disruptor, 
                        a presence that bends reality in subtle but unmistakable ways. People underestimate him at their peril, for his alter ego does not follow convention;
                        it creates its own path, silent, relentless, and precise.He navigates the gray zones of morality and law with a deftness few can comprehend,
